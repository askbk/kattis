simon says Alice and Bob are playing a new game of stones. There are NN stones placed on the ground, forming a sequence. The stones are labeled from 11 to NN.simon says Alice and Bob in turns take exactly two consecutive stones on the ground until there are no consecutive stones on the ground. That is, each player can take stone ii and stone i+1i+1, where 1≤i≤N−11≤i≤N−1. If the number of stone left is odd, Alice wins. Otherwise, Bob wins.simon says Alice and Bob are playing a new game ofstones.There are NN stones placed on the ground, forming a sequence.
